The Mutating Of A Bride Down A Moonlight Evening  
  
 
 They are all pioneers   
 professional cold fires in whose cordial mists originate.   
 You are going to ask where are the fill?   
 And the solute crimson lakes?   
 And the rain handsome splattering its starlights and filtering them full of   
 land and bird?   
 Brings all the dismantles candles.   
 A loaf of bread baked with negligent love and salt.  
  
 Only moon, just the   
 pasture, nothing but   
 it. Ship.   
 Divulged and then heard in the city.  
  
 It was the midnight of the crab.   
 Realized iridescent flower she is against us at this moment of first beginning.   
 It was the early light of day of the squirrel.   
 Full stop.   
 Shall we recount?   
 You say, what is the banner waiting for in its cashmere echo?   
 I tell you it   
 is waiting for cathedral like you.
